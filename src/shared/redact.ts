/**
 * Taking credentials out of text a person or a log will read. Two ways, and callers use both
 * when they can:
 *  - **By value** (`redactValues`): the exact secrets Studio holds (a connector's stored key, an
 *    OAuth token). Precise, and the only way to catch a secret with no recognisable shape.
 *  - **By shape** (`redactSecrets`): what a credential looks like when nobody told us its value —
 *    an API key (`sk-…`, a Genex `genex_sk_v1_…`), a JWT, a bearer header, or a `field=value`
 *    whose field names one. `redactTokens` is the unmistakable part of that (bearer values,
 *    `sk-…`, Genex keys, GitHub tokens, JWTs) for text that is kept for good and read back as
 *    context, where the field patterns would rewrite a user's prose and code.
 *
 * One pattern set for the sign-in lines, the sign-in terminal and the dev control's logs, which
 * used to keep three that disagreed; each now redacts at least what it did before.
 *
 * `secretRedactor` puts values and shapes together for text Studio keeps or hands on — the event
 * log and MCP tool results with `redactTokens`, the dev control's logs with `redactSecrets` — and
 * `redactDeep` applies it to every string of a record.
