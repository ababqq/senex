/**
 * Event log schema: the contract the substrate writes, the harness reads over RPC and the
 * renderer reads through `window.studio`. `substrate/types.ts` re-exports these types next to the
 * store's own errors, so substrate code keeps importing them from there.
 *
 * The envelope is bit-compatible with Exo's `crates/exoharness/src/types.rs` event record so
 * that upstream Exo stays a living reference and cross-validation target (§12.2):
 *
 *   { id, thread_id, session_id, turn_id, created_at, data }
 *
 * `conversation_id` is accepted as an alias on read (Exo's serde alias) and never written.
 *
 * Deviation from Exo, documented in the plan: Exo's `sandbox_*` (Docker) event family is
 * replaced by the workspace family — `snapshot_created` / `workspace_restored` — because D7
 * makes git the snapshot engine. Everything else keeps Exo's kind names, including using
 * `custom { event_type: "rebuild_and_restart_studio" }` for guardian outcomes.
