# Assets

Files made by the studio's own tools — Blender first. `assets/<name>.glb` is committed with
the project, served to the preview and copied by export; `assets/src/<name>.py` is the Blender
script that made it (re-running it replaces the file). Load with `loadAsset("<name>")` from
`src/assets.js`. Never downloaded, never copied from `references/`.
