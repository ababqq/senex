/**
 * The hook bundle's entry — served as a module AFTER the page's import map, because a module tag
 * ahead of a map disables it.
 *
 * It exists so the hook is on every page, including a page whose `three` never passes through the
 * import map at all (a bundled project, which reaches the hook through
 * `installStudio({ renderer, player })` and therefore needs `window.__studioHook` to be there).
 * The import is a URL, left alone by the bundler, so this entry and the wrapper module the serve
 * layer generates load the SAME module record — one hook, one set of records, one world.
