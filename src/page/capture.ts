/**
 * The end-of-frame photograph (M4.9a).
 *
 * The rule this file exists to enforce is: never re-render to take a picture. A project with a
 * post-processing composer draws its world into a target and its last pass is what the user
 * sees, so a capture that re-renders from (scene, camera) photographs a frame the player never
 * looked at — no bloom, no tone map, no grade — and the judge then argues with the screenshot.
 * So the capture waits for the END of a frame the project drew itself and reads the canvas in the
 * same JS turn, which is exactly as long as a WebGL drawing buffer survives without
 * `preserveDrawingBuffer`.
 *
 * The second thing it does is composite. A canvas created with `alpha: true` (three's default)
 * hands back a frame with transparent pixels wherever nothing was drawn, and `toDataURL` keeps
 * that alpha, so the pixel arithmetic downstream measured black where the player saw the page's
 * own background. One `fillRect` of the resolved page background under one `drawImage` fixes
 * that, and it is a no-op for an opaque frame — which is why it is unconditional and there is
 * no attribute sniffing and no second path. A page whose background is an image or a gradient
 * cannot be resolved to one colour, so the capture refuses and the compositor takes the frame.
 *
 * Everything is built from injected dependencies, so the whole ladder is testable under
 * `node --test` with stub canvases and a stub clock.
