/**
 * Thread compaction — the local-model answer to a finite context window.
 *
 * The log is append-only and never loses anything; compaction *adds* a `compacted` event whose
 * summary replaces everything before it at prompt time (see prompt.ts). It fires automatically
 * when a thread's history outgrows the model (turn-loop checks before each turn) and on demand
 * from the UI ("Compact now"). The summary is written by the same engine at low effort — an
 * unattended summariser has no business thinking deeply.
