 * session that asks carries (a project chat's own session, a build's lead, the run's coordinator) and
 * which only Auto reads (and Plan, where it runs with Auto's semantics).
 *
 * Auto should let a person building a project have everything ordinary project work needs without a
 * question, and keep stopping what is truly dangerous. Claude Code's own rules already do the
 * second; the studio only adds what the classifier cannot know from the transcript (the person's
 * own Mac, the person in the chat, the project folder's checkpoints) and narrows the built-in blocks
 * that everyday project work trips: each entry names the blocks it narrows and what stays blocked.
 * The soft and hard blocks themselves stay as Claude Code ships them, so a CLI update's new
 * protections apply unchanged.
 *
 * The CLI reads `autoMode` only from user, flag (the SDK's `settings`) and managed settings, never
 * from a project's own `.claude` files; `"$defaults"` keeps its built-in entries in place (a list
 * without it replaces them). It sends the same rules to the server-side classifier.
