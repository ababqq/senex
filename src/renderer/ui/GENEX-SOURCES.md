# Genex UI provenance

Imported with the application owner's authorization from their sibling repository
`genex-cli-threejs`, commit `e67920b591cff31d7d537a5477033a056840721a` (19 September 2026).
The source checkout was read only. Studio builds use local files and never require that checkout.
Paths below are relative to its `apps/web/` directory.

The owner's contributions and Studio adaptations use the repository's MIT license. Fonts and
other upstream components retain their separate notices. The code license grants no trademark
rights in the Genex name or logo.

| Source | Local adaptation |
| --- | --- |
| `public/genex-logo-dark.svg` | `ui/GenexLogo.tsx`: original dark wordmark paths and gradients, JSX attribute names and accessible image name |
| `app/globals.css`, `app/layout.tsx` | `src/renderer/theme.css`: dark tokens, type roles, offline font faces, tracking, surfaces and motion; desktop semantic aliases preserved |
| `app/fonts/{ZalandoSansSemiExpanded,GeistMono,Geist}-variable.woff2` | The same binaries in `src/renderer/fonts/` |
| `components/dom/ui/button.tsx`, `accent-chip.tsx` | `ui/Button.tsx`, `accent-chip.tsx`; secondary default for existing Studio actions, primary intents explicitly mapped |
| `components/dom/ui/{dropdown-menu,popover,switch,tooltip,input,textarea}.tsx` | Same primitives in `ui/`; desktop overlay stacking, import paths and accent semantics adapted |
| `components/dom/ui/dialog.tsx` | `ui/dialog.tsx`; desktop Radix branch, shared sizing, focus restoration and exit lifecycle; no mobile drawer |
| `components/dom/ui/{view-switcher,animate-height}.tsx` | Same components in `ui/`; keyboard navigation and font-resize measurement added |
| `lib/utils.ts` | `ui/cn.ts`: class composition and type-role merging; unrelated helpers omitted |
| `components/dom/ui/prompt-bar.tsx`, `components/create/{ComposerDock,Transcript,ChatMarkdown}.tsx` | Presentation adapted into existing Studio composer/transcript; existing safe Markdown, runtime model/role data, attachment and send/stop semantics retained |
| `components/dom/ui/pixel-loader.tsx` | `LoadingState.tsx`: the Genex shimmer and token roles; the pixel grid is drawn anew |

The original application's business code is not part of this transfer. Existing Studio
project, provider, plugin-consent and run logic remain the behavior authority.
The web app's primitives (`Button`, `dialog`, `dropdown-menu`, `input`, `popover`, `switch`,
`textarea`, `tooltip` and `cn.ts`) follow shadcn/ui, credited in
[THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](../../../THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md#shadcnui).

## Font licenses

Font binaries are as published upstream (Geist Mono is its Google Fonts Latin subset). Each is
licensed under SIL Open Font License 1.1; full notices ship beside the binaries. License texts were retrieved from the upstream Google Fonts copies:

- [Zalando Sans SemiExpanded OFL](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/zalandosanssemiexpanded/OFL.txt)
- [Geist OFL](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/geist/OFL.txt)
- [Geist Mono OFL](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/geistmono/OFL.txt)

The Geist fallback is restricted to the source's Greek/Cyrillic Unicode ranges; it does not
replace the Latin Zalando face. There are no runtime font-network requests.

## Other notices

The Genex icon set in `ui/icons.tsx` is drawn for this app; its motion is plain CSS in
`styles/icons.css`. Lucide, Radix, Base UI, CVA, clsx, Tailwind Merge and animation CSS
retain their installed package licenses; the build gathers notices from actual bundled dependencies.

## AG-966 search and cover adaptation (20 September 2026)

Read from the owner's same sibling checkout, kept read-only:
- `apps/web/components/header/SearchBox.tsx` → `panels/ProjectSearchDialog.tsx`: dialog layout,
  debounce, keyboard navigation and thumbnail rows, adapted to the local library.
- `packages/catalog-search/src/{types,tokenize,buildIndex,query}.ts` → `src/shared/catalog-search/`:
  local BM25 engine, with prototype-safe index dictionaries. No package installation.
- `apps/web/components/project-page/CoverDialog.tsx` → `panels/ProjectCoverDialog.tsx`: local crop,
  preview and save flow. Normalize uploads to 256px PNG for Electron's native image decoder
  (the web source used WebP). No R2 upload, API request, analytics or paid AI regeneration.

`shared/project-cover.ts` and the default geometric placeholder are original procedural code for
this task. Existing fonts, logo paths and third-party notices are unchanged.
