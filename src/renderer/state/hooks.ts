// only because every field it selects is a primitive or a reference the store already holds:
// `useShallow` compares the fields one by one with Object.is, so the component re-renders at
// exactly the moments separate one-field selectors would have made it. A field that builds a new
// array, set or object (`busyThreadIds`, `railThreadIds`) would differ on every store update and
// re-render on each; such derivations stay in the component's `useMemo`, over the fields here.
