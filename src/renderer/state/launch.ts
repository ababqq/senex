/**
 * A project started from home: the first message, on its way to the project it makes. Home sends it;
 * the project is named, made and opened (`launchProject` in `studio.ts`); then the project's own chat sends
 * the message as if it had been typed there, so every route a message can take (a plan to review,
 * a Loop, pictures) stays the chat's. While a launch is out the shell shows the chat and stage it
 * is becoming. A launch that fails gives its words back to home.
 *
 * Actions are pure `(state, input) => state` and ignore a step for any launch but the current one.
