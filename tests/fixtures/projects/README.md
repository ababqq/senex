# Five projects nobody wrote the studio's contract for

Every project the rest of this repository exercises was written by the studio, in the studio's own
shape: one `index.html` with the vendored import map, one `src/main.js` that calls
`installStudio`, one first-person player. That makes a whole class of failure invisible — the
studio can only be proved to run "any Three.js project" against projects it did not write. These five
folders are those projects. Each one is a real page a browser can open, in a shape somebody
actually ships, and none of them was written to be judged: they are here so that the shim, the
renderer hook, the readiness poll, the evidence pass and the checks are tested against code that
never heard of any of them.

## The five shapes

| folder | title | shape | edits | proves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `inline-raf` | Sweep | one `index.html`, an inline module, its own `requestAnimationFrame` loop | none | the shim owns the clock for a page that never heard of the studio |
| `esm-addons` | Orbit Yard | ES modules, the five import-map keys, `three/addons`, an `EffectComposer` | none | addons resolve with no install; the judged frame is the composer's output |
| `bundled-ts` | Corridor | TypeScript bundled to `dist/`, `three` as a bare specifier inside the bundle | two lines | a bundled project attaches with `installStudio({ renderer, player })` |
| `menu-levels` | Two Rooms | DOM UI, a menu → level-select → level state machine, two scenes and two cameras | none | a title screen becomes ready, and the setup script walks it to the judged state |
| `webgpu-field` | Ion Field | `three/webgpu`, a top-level `await renderer.init()`, `setAnimationLoop` | none | the WebGPU backend is recognised everywhere `isWebGLRenderer` was the gate |

## The rules every fixture keeps

These are not style preferences. Each one is asserted by
`tests/conformance/shapes-fixtures.test.ts`, and a fixture that breaks one stops being evidence
of anything.

1. **No studio scaffold, and above all no `studio.json` carrying `contractVersion`.** That field
   plus the vendored import map is the one proof `detectProjectShape` reads to say "this folder
   is the studio's template". A fixture that carries it is testing the template again.
2. **No network.** Every bare specifier resolves through an import map to the copies the studio
   serves under `/vendor/`, or is bundled from the repo's own `node_modules`. There is no CDN
   tag, no `https://` import and no install step in any fixture.
3. **Every fixture carries an import map** with at least the `three` key, unless it is bundled.
   A no-build own-shape project with an unresolved bare specifier is a hard validation problem
   before its page ever loads, so it would prove nothing about the runtime.
4. **Under 300 lines and 12 KB per source file.** A fixture is read far more often than it is
   run.
5. **A `README.md` whose first paragraph says what the shape proves.** Adoption seeds `NOTES.md`
   from exactly that file (`ProjectWorkspaces#folderReadme`), so the paragraph is also a live check
   of that path.
6. **A `manifest.json`** (version 1) recording what the studio must answer about the folder:
   the shape `detectProjectShape` returns, the files adoption may and may not add, the kind and
   traits, the setup script, the cameras, the warnings the night should produce and the ones it is
   allowed to, and the state paths a play script must move.

## Adding a sixth shape

1. Make the folder, write the project, keep it under the caps and inside the rules above.
2. Write `README.md` — first paragraph, at least 200 characters, what this shape proves and
   nothing else.
3. Write `manifest.json`. `shape` must deep-equal what `detectProjectShape` answers; run the
   conformance test and paste in what it reports rather than guessing.
4. `addsAtLeast` is a **subset** relation and `neverAdded` a **must-not-contain** one, against
   `plannedWrites(dir, { template: false })`. Never write the template's whole file list into a
   fixture: it changes for reasons that have nothing to do with these shapes.
5. `expectWarnings` entries are **substrings**, matched with `warnings.some((w) => w.includes(s))`,
   and each must be a literal substring of a sentence in the harness seed. That is what makes a
   renamed warning fail in `npm test` instead of only in the e2e. `expectWarnings` is what the run
   MUST warn about and `allowWarnings` what it MAY: together they are the whole list, because the
   e2e fails on any warning neither names (`tests/e2e/warning-policy.ts`). An empty pair means this
   project warns about nothing, which is a claim the sheet now checks instead of skipping. The one
   exception is the warning a slow machine earns — a boot over five seconds is about the laptop,
   not the project — and it is named once, in `MACHINE_WARNINGS`.
6. Only one fixture may declare `edits: "two-line-install"`. Everything else is `edits: "none"`,
   because a fixture that is "fixed" by adding `installStudio` stops being the thing under test.

## Deliberately unproven

These are decisions, not omissions. Each one costs more to fake than it would prove:

- **A real `vite.config` with a non-default `outDir`.** `bundled-ts` builds with esbuild from the
  repo's own `node_modules`, because Vite is not a dependency of this repository and installing
  one would open the network in a test. What the studio sees is identical either way — `kindOf`
  answers `three-vite` from three-in-dependencies plus a build script, `outputDir` answers
  `dist`, `packageCommands` answers `npm run build`. The `outDir`-reading branch of `outputDir`
  is covered by `project-shape.test.ts` instead.
- **A GLB asset load.** A binary asset in a fixture is a binary asset in the repository, and the
  loader path it would exercise is three's, not the studio's.
- **Physics.** No physics engine is vendored, and adding one would be an install.
- **A gamepad.** Chromium grants no gamepad to a hidden window, so the fixture could only test
  the studio's synthetic path against itself.
- **Other engines** — Phaser, plain canvas 2D, Unity and Godot exports. They are a different
  contract and a different milestone; `detectProjectShape` already names them, and refusing them
  early is the studio's whole answer for now.

## What `bundled-ts` does not build into

`bundled-ts` is checked in **without** `dist/`, and its `src/main.ts` imports `./studio.js`,
which exists only after the studio adopts the folder. That is deliberate in both directions: a
checked-in `dist/` would let the build path rot silently — which is the exact failure this
milestone exists to catch — and a fixture that builds standalone would not be proving that
adoption gives a bundled project a contract module it can import. The runner adopts the copy, links
the repo's `node_modules` into it (`manifest.needsNodeModules`), and only then builds.
