# Local asset viewer samples

Small, synthetic format samples created locally for Studio's preview acceptance; no paid generations or user project assets.

- Blender 4.5.4 default Suzanne mesh, one material and 49-frame Z-rotation: GLB, separate glTF/buffer, FBX, OBJ/MTL, STL, PLY.
- Blender default scene + Suzanne with Draco compression: compressed.glb.
- Blender floating-point 32×16 gradient saved with OPEN_EXR render settings: texture.exr. HDR sample is a small constant-color image.
- KTX2: Three.js official `examples/textures/ktx2/2d_etc1s.ktx2` sample, retrieved 22 September 2026 from https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/textures/ktx2/2d_etc1s.ktx2. SHA-256 `e56ddcc757fc73ff06bb0dac2a3533ce79c1e196ad895a3ff7dcc4d9de6b9d5d`. This exercises real Basis transcoding, not just raw-container reading. See the upstream MIT notice below.
- FFmpeg lavfi testsrc (128×96, 12fps, two seconds): video.mp4 and animated.gif. Sine 440Hz, two seconds: tone.wav.
- notes.json is plain metadata. broken.glb deliberately contains invalid text.

Run after building:

```sh
node tests/e2e/run-build-smoke.mjs --studio-assets-smoke-dir=tests/fixtures/asset-previews
```

The optional real-file acceptance also accepts `retained.glb` and `retained.mp3` in a separate directory. It must not copy a user's assets into this checked-in fixture directory. The runner records their inclusion; no missing retained file is represented as a passed real-asset check.
