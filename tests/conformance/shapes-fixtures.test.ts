/**
 * The five shapes, guarded without an Electron in sight.

 * `tests/fixtures/projects` holds five projects nobody wrote the studio's contract for. They are only
 * evidence while they stay that way: the moment one of them grows a `studio.json` with a
 * `contractVersion`, a CDN tag, or a second `installStudio`, it is testing the template again and
 * every claim this milestone makes about "any Three.js project" is quietly false. These are the
 * rules that keep them real, and they run in `npm test`, not only in the e2e — a renamed warning
 * or a drifted shape has to fail in seconds, on a laptop, with no window open.
